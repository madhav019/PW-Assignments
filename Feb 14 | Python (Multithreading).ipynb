    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute. In other words, the result of the program depends on the relative timing of the threads. Race conditions can occur when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization. For example, if two threads access a shared variable simultaneously, the result may depend on which thread executes first. Race conditions can cause unpredictable behavior, including incorrect results or program crashes."
