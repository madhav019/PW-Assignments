If two functions access same memory part then they might fall into the condition where they both try to modify that space according to there needs and the en result could be some unpredictible value. This condition is called **race-around** condition. To get around this problem of concurrency the python interpreter uses a concept called Global Interpreter Lock. The GIL locks the interpreter for one thread accessing a critical part of memory, while the lock is acquired no other thread can access the interpreter let alone perform any memory operations.\n",
